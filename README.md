# Markov (MOM Ali functional testing platform)

## Overview

Markov(MOM Ali functional testing platform)is a new generation of functional testing platform self-developed in the context of test transformation. Compared with traditional functional testing frameworks, it has many advantages, such as visual use case writing management and distributed sandbox environment. and test data construction, test process pipeline management. Besides, many intelligent testing technologies have been derived based on the platform, such as use case recommendation based on Naive Bayes, use case recommendation based on parameter combination expansion filtering, intelligent regression technology base on use case orchestration algorithm, intelligent investigation system based on use case portrait. Accurate and intelligent testing, etc. We can think of Markov as a new generation of the functional testing framework. Compared with the traditional classic testing framework - a.g.: pytest + jenkins - the Markov model has a lower threshold for users, which makes it simple for students who do not understand test development and algorithms.
The self-service test has achieved the goal of making the world no difficult " to test".
